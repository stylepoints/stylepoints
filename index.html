      Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!"
      I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction.

      How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname?
      We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun?
      Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs.
      Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze. Dad didn't leaveâ€¦ When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those
      pop-tarts right in your face!
