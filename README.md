# React Starter [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/Thomas0c/react-starter.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Thomas0c/react-starter)

> Universal React seed (boilerplate) w. modificatons based on [react-starter](https://github.com/richardkall/react-starter).

#### Modifications
Why not build a boilerplate from scratch? Because: 1) time, 2) too many boilerplates already. Richard KÃ¤ll's work is great, and I see no reason to re-do what he has already done well, just to say that I made it from scratch.

- [webpack-isomorphic-tools](https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/webpack-isomorphic-tools) allows us to fully support loading and serving images and styles client- as well as server-side.


#### Note to beginners
- Boilerplates are not beginner-friendly, and this is not an exception. While this might be a great playground for you to explore tooling, combination of libraries etc. I highly recommend getting to know React, Webpack, Redux etc. one by one. For that purpose I can highly recommend [React.js Program](http://www.reactjsprogram.com/), [Redux on Egghead](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) and [React how to](https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto).
